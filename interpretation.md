### Meaning of the findings and how they are useful for the business case

Discovery shows that there is a meaningful connection between gaming hours and holidays, but also with weekends. When taking average gaming hours into considerations, holidays on weekdays were the highest, with weekends right after, with not much difference between weekends on holidays and no holidays. Findings also show there is correlation between holidays and gaming hours, but more so with weekends, the highest correlation is though when it is both a weekend and holiday. 

Taking this into consideration the findings could be useful for marketing purposes, as these correlations show which days people play the most and advertising games before these days would help with getting a new customer base
