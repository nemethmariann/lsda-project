# Key Performance Indicators

## Forecast Accuracy 
Measures the accuracy of the demand forecasts (predicted gaming hours) compared to the actual hours played.

Measurement: Calculated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to determine the average percentage difference between predicted and actual values.

Business Goal: High accuracy ensures that marketing budgets are allocated effectively, avoiding overspending on low-impact days or missing opportunities on high-demand holidays.

## Marketing Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)
The amount of gross revenue earned for every dollar spent on advertising during holiday-targeted campaigns.

Measurement: (Revenue from Holiday Campaign / Cost of Holiday Campaign).

Business Goal: By using the Public Holiday API to time advertisements perfectly with "gaming booms," we aim to increase the efficiency of ad spend compared to non-targeted seasonal campaigns.

## Holiday Retention Rate
The percentage of players who joined or returned during a public holiday and remained active in the following 30 days.

Measurement: Tracking the Day 30 (D30) Retention of cohorts that were acquired specifically during holiday-themed promotions.

Business Goal: To verify if the forecasting-driven marketing is attracting "sticky" players who provide long-term Lifetime Value (LTV), rather than just temporary holiday traffic.
